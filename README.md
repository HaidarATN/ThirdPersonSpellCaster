# ThirdPersonSpellCaster
Prototype game project. Having fun with some Distance Matching animation and spell casting mechanism using "HellDivers 2" stratagem approach.

This is not the whole project, but just some key component of the project. I know since it is created in Unreal, some of them are .uassets sadly.

If you want to try the game, you can go to this GDrive link :
