# ThirdPersonSpellCaster
Prototype game project. Having fun with some Distance Matching animation and spell casting mechanism using "HellDivers 2" stratagem approach.
Also having with tweaking the animation so it have a smooth and blend flows from each actions the character did.

This is not the whole project, but just some key component of the project. I know since it is created in Unreal, some of them are .uassets sadly.

If you want to try the game, you can go to this GDrive link :

GAME CONTROL :
WASD -> Move
Hold left CTRL -> Begin Chanting State
Up, Down, Left, Right arrow key -> When in chanting state, press the correct combination of spell
Left Shift -> Blink

You also have stamina that will be used to go in chanting state and blinking.
